# Facebook-design-patterns

Creating a Facebook desktop application using Facebook SDK and FbGraphApiWrapper
(.NET Framework 4, WinForms, Visual Studio).

This is a Windows Facebook app.
The app gives the user a basic Facebook experience and in addition provides the user with two Facebook-related features that are not implemented on the Facebook site.
The application gives relevant value to its user and is organized in a way that is easy to use.
In the word file there is an explanation of the features that I implemented and also an explanation of the design patterns that were implemented.
In addition there is an explanation of asynchronous work and data bilding.
